    <h1>HTML Tutorial</h1>
    <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.<br>
        Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.<br>
        HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects<br>
        such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create<br> 
        structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links,<br>
        quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as<br>
        and directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as surround and<br> 
        provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not<br> 
        display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</p>

    <h2>Markup</h2>
    <p>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes),<br> 
        character-based data types, character references and entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in<br> 
        pairs like and although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example.<br>
        The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening<br>
        tags and closing tags).<br>

        Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode<br>
        rendering.<br>

        The following is an example of the classic "Hello, World!" program:<br></p>
    <pre><code>
<p>
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>This is a title</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <p>Hello world!</p>
        </body>
    </html>
</p>
    </code></pre>
</body>
</html>
